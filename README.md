### Short Intro:

I have a linguistics background. 
I studied german language and literature at the LMU in Munich. 

<br>


After graduating I started learning __HTML__, __CSS__ and a little bit of __JavaScript__ and worked for a short while as an intern in an advertising agency (d3media) in Hamburg. Then my interest shifted to web development and I learned __Python__. 2023 I attended a data practitioner bootcamp at the IT School neuefische Hamburg. I learned __Git/GitHub__, __SQL__, __Pandas__, __Numpy__, __Visualization (MatplotLib, Plotly, Seaborn)__, __web application streamlit__, __Machine Learning__ (Regression models, clustering, KNN, ...), __FAST APIs__ and working with __Tableau__. I obtained my Data Practitioner certificat after six months of training. In the last few months after finishing the bootcamp I learned __Python for andvanced users__, __Django__, __SQL Masterclass__ and __HTML-CSS Masterclass__ to get closer to my goal of being a web developer.
