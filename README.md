## Hello! 
## I'm Shahi, a data practitioner trainee at neuefische. 
---
<br>

I have a linguistics background. 
I studied german language and literature at the LMU in Munich. 

<br>

After graduating I started learning __Javascript__, __HTML__ and __CSS__ and worked for a short while as an intern in an advertising agency in Hamburg. Then my focus shifted to web development and I learned __Python__. At neuefische I learned __Git/GitHub__, __SQL__, __Pandas__, __Numpy__, __Visualization (MatplotLib, Plotly, Seaborn)__.
